          <h3 id="headline">Who is Dr. Bello Muhammad:</h3>
          <li>Bello Muhammad (born February 12, 1962), known as <strong>Bello Matawalle</strong>, 
            is a Nigerian politician and teacher who has served as the Governor of Zamfara State since 
            <strong>2019</strong>. After briefly serving in the Abacha-era state house of assembly and serving as 
            a state commissioner from <strong>1999 to 2003</strong> in the Ahmad Sani Yerima administration in the Fourth 
            Republic, he first won a elected office in <strong>2003</strong> as a member of the House of Representatives

            <strong>2019</strong> PDP gubernatorial nominee and won the office after a Supreme Court ruling disqualified the 
            original winner. In <strong>2021</strong>, he defected from the PDP to the All Progressives Congress after 
            a defection rally in Gusau alongside most Zamfara State elected officials.</li>

            for Local Government and Chieftaincy Affairs, Commissioner for Environment, 
            Rural Development and then Commissioner for Youth and Sports.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>2003</strong> - Matawalle was elected into the House of Representatives by 
            his constituents Bakura/Maradun, on the platform of the defunct All Nigeria Peoples Party (ANPP).
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>2007</strong> - Matawalle was re-elected still on the platform of the 
            ANPP only to defect to PDP on which platform he was re-elected for a third term in 2011.

            534,541 votes for Muktar Idris, the APC candidate.<br>
            Muktar Idris was at first, issued the certificate of return, 
            however, the court of appeal in Sokoto ordered that the INEC should withdraw the certificate.
            The Supreme Court later pronounced that the votes cast for the APC in the election as wasted 
            and ordered that the candidate with the second highest votes be sworn in on Wednesday. 
            This is because the APC failed to conduct primary election for all the candidates in Zamfara State.
